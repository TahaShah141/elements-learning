    <BlogParagraph text={`The solar system has been a topic of study from the beginning of history. For nearly all that time, people have had to rely on long range and indirect measurements of its objects. For all of human history and prehistory, observations were based on visible light. Then in the 20th century, people discovered how to use additional parts of the spectrum. Radio waves, received here on Earth, have been used since 1931 to investigate celestial objects. Starting with the emergence of space flight in 1957, instruments operating above Earth's obscuring atmosphere could take advantage not only of light and radio, but virtually the whole spectrum. At last, with interplanetary travel, instruments can be carried to many solar system objects, to measure their physical properties and dynamics directly and at very close range. In the 21st century, knowledge of the solar system is advancing at an unprecedented rate.`} />,

    <BlogParagraph text={"The four inner planets are known to be rocky, and they are classified as terrestrial planets. "} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={"The four outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are gas giants — largely hydrogen and some helium, with small solid cores. They're also called Jovian planets."} />,
    
    <BlogHeader text={"Why Eclipse occurs - planets orbit in Ecliptic plane"} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={"The Sun and planets each rotate on their axes. Because they formed from the same rotating disk, the planets, most of their satellites, and the asteroids, all revolve around the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates, and in nearly circular orbits. The planets orbit the Sun in or near the same plane, called the ecliptic (because it is where eclipses occur). Originally regarded as the ninth planet, Pluto always seemed a special case in that its orbit is highly inclined (by 17 degrees) and highly elliptical. "} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={"Today we recognize it as a dwarf planet, as well as a member of the Kuiper Belt. Most planets rotate in or near the plane in which they orbit the Sun, again because they formed, rotating, out of the samedust ring. The exception, Uranus, must have suffered a whopping collision that set it rotating on its side."} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={`All of the planets lie within a few degrees of the "ecliptic plane," as can be seen in the image below. All planets except Uranus have their axis of spin oriented relatively perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Uranus' spin axis lies roughly in its direction of its orbital path around the sun.`} />,

    <BlogHeader text={"What is the farthest Object in Solar System"} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={`The Oort cloud is a hypothesized spherical reservoir of comet nuclei, the bulk of which would orbit roughly 50,000 AU nearly a lightyear from the Sun. No confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made yet, but astronomers believe that it is the source of all long period comets that enter the inner Solar System when their orbits are disturbed.`} />,
    
    <BlogHeader text={"What is Galactic Year - SUN’s trajectory in the Milky Way"} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={`Sun is situated about 26,000 to 30,000 light years from the galactic centre. Circumference of the of the Sun's orbit is about 150,000 light years. Sun is moving at the speed of 782,000 km/hour or 486,000 m/hour. Sun completes one orbit in 225 to 250 million years. This is known as one Galactic year or one cosmic year. Sun is about 5 billion years old. So it has completed about 20 to 22 orbit from its birth. Sun's orbit around the Galactic Centre is roughly elliptical with the additional perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non uniform mass distributions. In addition, the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. In its motion through the Milky Way, Sun is moving in the general direction of the Star Vega.`} />,
    <BlogParagraph text={`The following picture indicates the motion of sun in the galaxy. It actually has a periodic motion as it moves around the Galaxy, slowly moving up above the galactic plane then being pulled back down below by the disk stars`} />,
