It's not terribly surprising that they didn't embrace it immediately.” As Luis Alvarez joked: “We were caught practicing geology without a license.”",

This is a point known to geology as the KT boundary and it marks the time, sixty-five million years ago, when the dinosaurs and roughly half the world's other species of animals abruptly vanish from the fossil record. K comes either from the Greek Kreta or German Kreide. Both conveniently mean “chalk,” which is also what Cretaceous means",
